# inStrain 

Detailed docs coming soon. Basically, this pipeline takes the output of dRep and sequencing reads from each sample. The pipeline is split into two parts, inStrain _profile_ and inStrain _compare_. 

By default, genomes from dRep that have >1x coverage in >=2 samples are considered for inStrain profiling.
