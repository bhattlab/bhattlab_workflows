set up singularity hub!
go to singularity-hub.org
sign in with github
create a collection and associate it with your github repository

write and revise a container recipe.  For an example, please
see the model available in this folder.
commit changes to the container recipe and push to your repo
the image on singularity hub will build automatically after new commits



#================================================================
#SUPPLEMENTAL STUFF

#execute a single command on your image (can be sandbox or simg)
singularity exec test_build[.simg] command goes here


#if you want to build singularity images interactively, you can do the following:

#first, connect to your vm
#go to vm instances in navigation bar
#make sure vm hardware is modest and cheap
#start vm on cloud.google.com
#get ip address once it's started
#ssh into vm
